Phase 2: Pose Estimation and Swing Classification (pose_estimator.py)

YOLOv8-Pose provides keypoints for the human body.
Keypoints typically include: Nose, Eyes, Ears, Shoulders, Elbows, Wrists, Hips, Knees, Ankles.

Important for Swing Classification:

The classify_swing above is VERY basic. True swing classification often requires:
Tracking the player over frames.
Analyzing a sequence of poses, not just a single frame (e.g., looking at the motion path of the wrist).
More sophisticated geometric features (body rotation, shoulder angles, racket trajectory inferred from hand).
Potentially a machine learning classifier (e.g., LSTM, SVM, RandomForest) trained on sequences of keypoints labeled with swing types.
You'll need to experiment heavily with the logic and parameters in classify_swing.
Consider the phase of the swing (preparation, impact, follow-through). The impact phase is most critical for classification.
Phase 3: Ball Tracking with TrackNetV2 (ball_tracker.py)

This is the most challenging part as TrackNetV2 implementations vary.

Find and Setup TrackNetV2:
Search GitHub for "TrackNetV2 PyTorch" or "TrackNetV2 Python".
Clone the repository.
Follow its specific installation instructions and download its pre-trained weights.
Understand its input format (often a sequence of 3 frames) and output format (heatmap or ball coordinates).
Wrapper for TrackNetV2 (ball_tracker.py - conceptual):


Phase 4: Excluding Static Ball Interference

TrackNetV2 should be good at focusing on the moving ball and ignoring static ones due to its temporal input. However, if it still picks up static balls, or if you use a generic ball detector:

Movement Threshold:
Store detected ball positions from the previous frame.
If a ball is detected in the current frame, compare its position to all balls from the previous frame.
If a ball's position is within static_ball_movement_threshold_px of its position in the last static_ball_frames_threshold frames, consider it static.
This requires associating ball detections across frames (basic tracking).
Integrating into BallTracker (conceptual enhancement to filter_and_update_ball_tracking):


Phase 5: Integration and Main Loop Update (main.py)

Phase 6: Parameter Adjustment

Your configs/default_config.yaml already sets this up.
You'll need to experiment extensively with:
pose_confidence_threshold: Higher values mean fewer, but more reliable, keypoint detections.
ball_confidence_threshold: For TrackNet or any ball detector.
static_ball_movement_threshold_px: How much a ball needs to move to be considered non-static.
static_ball_frames_threshold: How many consecutive frames a ball must be near-stationary.
Swing classification parameters in pose_estimator.py (angles, distances). These are the most heuristic and will require the most tuning based on your specific camera angle and player style.
Key Challenges and Considerations:

TrackNetV2 Integration: This is often the hardest part. Ensure you can run the TrackNetV2 model standalone on sample frames/sequences before integrating.
Swing Classification Robustness: Single-frame pose is often insufficient. You might need to:
Implement a state machine (Idle -> Prep -> Swing -> Follow-through).
Analyze keypoint trajectories over a short window.
Train a dedicated ML model for swing classification using keypoint sequences.
Player Tracking: If multiple people are in the frame, YOLO-Pose will detect all. You'll need a simple tracker (e.g., based on bounding box IOU and keypoint similarity) to follow the player of interest.
Performance: Running two deep learning models (YOLO-Pose, TrackNetV2) per frame can be slow.
Consider downscaling frames before inference (but this can affect small object detection like the ball).
Process every Nth frame if real-time isn't critical.
Explore model optimization (e.g., TensorRT, ONNX Runtime) if speed is paramount.
Camera Angle: The logic for swing classification (especially simple geometric rules) will be highly dependent on the camera angle.
Racket Detection: YOLO-Pose doesn't detect the racket. Inferring racket position from hands is an approximation. A separate racket detector could improve swing analysis but adds more complexity.
This is a substantial project. Start by getting each component (pose, then ball tracking) working individually before trying to combine them. Good luck!
